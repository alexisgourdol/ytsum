# Youtube video summarization script

## Description

**Idea**: use AI to summarize transcripts from a youtube video

**Context**:
The first POC worked in early 2025 using the `fabric` framework.
A new attempt few month later failed (the error message mentionned a Youtube API error but the API calls were working correcly via test and monitoring on the GCP console - error message genereated in a code written by AI so exception handling was likely lacking)

This is another attempt, this time using
- a script that can be used via CLI
    - trying out claude code capabilities
- an integration with claude code for summarization
